<h1>Hamburger Bun Pizza</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
		I learned this recipe during 5th grade camp. You could tell the camp 
		facilities were not especially suited to cater to 100+ fifth graders. They 
		also knew we probably didn't care too much what we ate. What they came up 
		with were hundreds of hamberger buns covered with spaghetti sauce and pizza
		toppings, and to be honest, it's been one of my go-tos ever since.
	</p>
