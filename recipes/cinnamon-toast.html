<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>	This one is easy one tha I'm sure everyone has sorted out for themselves.
			Sometimes you just want some toast. Toast is good with jelly, butter,
			cinnamon... guacamole some tell me? But I found cinnamon and butter to be
			the least expensive way to satisfy my sweet tooth in the mornings. If you
			often have a craving for something sweet, keeping a jar of sugar and a small
			container of cinnamon around can provide months worth of cinnamon-sugar mix
			to get your sweet fix. It's a quick and easy addition to any breakfast, or a 
			satisfactory enough struggle food when you really can't afford to buy more 
			groceries one month.</p>
