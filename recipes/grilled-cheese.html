<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>	This is going to gross some people out, irritate others, and to some seem
			a disgrace to humanity. I mean it. People get serious about their grilled
			cheese, man. If you believe there's only one God-Ordained way to melt your
			favorite cheese on your favorite bread, you may want to avert your eyes- but 
			I implore you to read on and let me make my case.</p>
	<p>	Whether or not you may want to, you can make grilled cheese using the
			toaster and the microwave. I'm serious. You're allowed. Nobody is stopping
			you. Why couldn't you?</p>
	<p>	<q>Why Would you want to!?</q> you may be shrieking to the screen right
			now, hoping I come to my senses. I'll tell you why: Your roomates may have
			piled all the dishes in the sink, unrinsed, and left for the poor soul who 
			next stumbles across the need to cook for themselves. That poor soul is you.
			You're exhausted after school and classwork and the puddle of food and
			dishes in the sink fills you with dread. All you want is a motherf***** 
			grilled cheese and-</p>
	<p>	Stop there- Don't. Stress. What if there were some other way? What if there 
			were other tools to get your bread to toasty, golden perfection- another way
			to smother it in butter- another way to melt the cheese onto it in perfectly
			gooey deliciousness!? I'm here to tell you there's a way, and it's changed 
			my life as a student from hardly bearable to... well I'll be honest with 
			you... to just downright, spectacularly, absolutely bearable&trade;!</p>
	
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A couple slices of your favorite bread. Whole wheat bread tastes great 
				smothered in butter and cheese if you're pretending to be healthy</li>
		<li>A stick of butter or margarine</li>
		<li>A single slice of american cheese is all that's necessary, but you know
				you want more</li>
	</ul>
	
<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Toast your bread just how you like it.</li>
		<li>Spread your butter or margarine on both sides of each slice. Trust me,
				this is the secret to making it taste almost like real grilled 
				cheese.</li>
		<li>Place the cheese between your two slices of bread and microwave for 10 
				seconds or until cheese is fully melted.</li>
		<li>You've done it, you magnificent bastard! Sink your teeth in, make a few
				more, and enjoy.</li>
	</ol>
